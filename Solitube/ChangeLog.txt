	+ Drop Down menu updated
	+ Status bar information updated
	+ Quick Reference Manual updated
	+ Fixed a bug having DUAL & FAT switches on the audio goes +6db!

	+ GUI Updated. New drop down menu. Find it at the top right corner.
	+ IIR filter files updated for better sound quality.
	+ Re calibrated IIR gain stage.
	+ Analog switch now is "PREAMP" ~ "CONSOLE" mode. Read the description for more info at the status bar.
	+ New check button for enabling or disabling the delay compensantion.
	+ Delay Compensantion now displays milliseconds for true measurements.

Beta v1.00 build 127 - September 30 2017
	+ FAT switch: Added a dynamic process that gives you a more "fat" sound.
	+ GUI updated
	+ Minor bug fixes as always..
	+ CPU Utilization is now ~1.1%

Beta v1.00 build 126 - September 30 2017
	+ Analog switch function now controls the new amazing soundstage and tonality.
	+ Re-calibrated the Analog process.
	+ Re-calibrated Color process.
	+ Re-named Color selections into Greek letters.
	+ GUI Update** New grapgics and buttons.
	+ Labels knobs updated
	+ CPU Utilization is now ~1.4%
	+ Minor bug fixes as always..

Beta v1.00 build 125 - September 29 2017
	+ NEW!! An amazing update comes in this build, the soundstage and tonality is overkill.
The image is much more open, you can hear the depth of transients.
	+ Added a new function called "COLOR" knob. Switch between different capacitors.
	+ Added a new function called "HPF" knob. You can scale down the distortion of lows trimming them.
	+ Analog switch re-calibrated.
	+ Added a new function called "TRANSFORMER" knob. Now you can switch between different cores types.
	+ GUI: Updated
	+ System.ini: Some variables has been removed.
	+ Re-calibrated IIR gains.

Beta v1.00 build 117 - September 26 2017
	+ Re-Calibrated the Console Circuit. Now has that glueiness with more headroom when the saturatiob knob is full.
	+ System.ini: New entries variables to manipulate the core system of CT-S2.
	+ GUI: Minor changes in texts and alignments.
	+ FAT: Factory setting now is 0.5 intensity in the system.ini and that means that the 2nd harmonic is more present at ~-40/-20dB in contenx with saturation intensity.
	+ Analog noise circuit calibrated to be at -120dBFS by default when the CT-S2 in on power.

Beta v1.00 build 116 - September 25 2017
	+ Re-Calibrated all the modules (Level,Focus,Saturation,Impendance) into a stepped trimming/gain
to fine adjust the overall RMS vs PEAK behavior.
	+ Impendance now has true analog behavior tonallity. Mic is more silk at the top and beeffy at lows
and Inst(rument) has more clarity at the top.
	+ Transformer models re-texted so now you know what transformer core you select.
	+ Manual layer and contents fixed
	+ Settings: I/O Compensantion button added to compensate the gain of the input Level from the output.
PS (going the Level knob above 7~8dB you start to have more headroom and open sound)
	+ Settings: User Interface buttons now saves & loads automatically the state of the buttons after load.
	+ Midi Controller now saves & loads automatically the state of the selected input controller after load.
	+ Level knob now is in stepped mode (25 steps)
	+ Gain knob now is in stepped mode (25 steps)
	+ Power switch: Enable/Disable now has an 25ms fade in / fade out behavior for optimal and smooth
transistion between Dry & Wet signal.
	+ Out / VU Switch: now saves & loads automatically the switch state selection after load.

Beta v1.00 build 100 - September 18 2017
	+ Saturation: New Optimized encoder. Now any 12 stages has an array calibrated internaly +/-0.01dB
	+ Focus: Added new focus knob tamming the tone of the saturation of transformer.
	+ Focus: Added calibration page equalizer. Access via holding down the combination keys (Ctrl+Shift+C)
	+ System.ini: Added new variables to calibrate.
	+ Settings page: Added buttons for system.ini file, iir reloading, view folder, clear stream buffers cache.
	+ System.ini: Access calibration settings in front panel via holding down the combination keys (Ctrl+Shift+D)
	+ Switch Push: FAT adds 2nd Harmonic at -40dB
	+ Switch Analog: Trimmed down the internal gain at -18dB
	+ Settings page: Added button to custom set the license file location.
